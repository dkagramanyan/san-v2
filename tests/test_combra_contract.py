"""Assert every combra symbol this repo imports actually exists.

The eval path is deliberately fault-tolerant: a missing or broken combra must
never abort a training run. That tolerance is also how a real breakage hid for a
whole release. combra 0.5.0 removed ``angle_density_metrics_from_pooled``,
``fid_from_features`` and ``fd_dinov2_from_features`` and renamed
``combra_smoke_test``; this repo kept importing all four, the ``except`` around
the eval swallowed the ImportError every tick, and ``--combra-metrics true``
quietly produced nothing for months.

Nothing caught it because nothing asserted the symbols. This does — CPU-only, no
GPU, no dataset, no network, so it runs in every CI job. It is skipped only when
combra is genuinely absent, which is a different (and visible) condition.
